\chapter{Introduction} \label{introduction}

For further explanation and details, please, turn to the referred clauses of IEEE 29148-2018, the highlighted and commented version; pay attention to the comments. Clause numbers are written in \textit{italic} in the sections.

Refer to \textit{(Clause 9.6.1)}. 

\section{Purpose of the System }
 Refer to \textit{(Clause 9.6.2, 9.5.2, 9.4.2)}. 

If you want to write unordered (bulleted) lists, you should use an "itemize" environment, where each list entry starts by using the \verb|\item| command, which also generates the bullet symbol.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Item1  
    \item Item2 
\end{itemize}

Numbered lists have the same syntax but use an "enumerate" environment: each entry must be preceded by the \verb|\item|, which will automatically generate numbers to label the item.
